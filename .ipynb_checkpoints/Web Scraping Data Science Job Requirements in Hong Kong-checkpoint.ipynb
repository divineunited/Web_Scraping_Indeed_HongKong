    "# Web Scraping Indeed.com for Data Science Job Requirements in Hong Kong\n",
    "\n",
    "*By Danny Vu*\n",
    "\n",
    "This data analysis will be using Python's Scrapy framework to scrape Indeed.com for Data Science Job Requirements. Indeed does have a [REST API](https://github.com/indeedassessments/api-documentation) but at the time of this writing, the API is still under construction so I will be performing web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/indeed-750.jpg\" alt=\"Indeed.com\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "After the web scraping of web pages linked to the search term `Data Science`, I will be analyzing the job description and generating visualizations of the top skills required for Data Science roles in Hong Kong.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Question: What are the main skills that a Data Scientist needs in Hong Kong?\n",
    "\n",
    "As an American expat moving to Hong Kong, I was interested in finding out how difficult it would be to get a job as a data scientist in this country. My main concerns are the fact that I only speak English and that I only have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science / Informatics. What are the skillsets that the job market looks for in Hong Kong?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Results:\n",
    "The main skills sought after were Computer Science, English, and Communication skills - no surprise there. What's surprising is that only 3-4% of Job Descriptions in Hong Kong mention a PHD requirement - which can often be seen as a requirement in the United States. Another nice touch for expats looking to get Data Science jobs in Hong Kong is that Cantonese and Mandarin are only mentioned as a requirement in about 15% of job descriptions and English is the dominant language in the job market here. Out of all the hard skills, SQL, Python, Statistics, and Machine Learning are the top sought after skills.\n",

    "### Part 1: Data Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "What is web scraping? It is extracting content from websites. First you need to study the website to know what information it has and where to get it from. Specifically, using HTML tags and CSS ids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you do it? If you don't have an API to get information you can programatically get data from a web page when no API's have been necessarily provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using Scrapy - a complete Python framework used for automatic web crawling and scraping. This will deal with the communication aspect of the operation between the server hosting the target website and our python console.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First, I inspect the website and test out an X-Path selector string using Chrome Developer Tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/IndeedInspect.png\" style=\"width: 1500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that all the requirements and job description details are always listed in bullet points. Therefore, our xpath selector for scrapy will be: `//div/ul/li/text()` when I want to get a list of requirements and `//head/title/text()` for the title of each page. Now, I need to create the spider to crawl across all the Data Science jobs in Hong Kong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This is where I crawl, across the entire search spectrum of Indeed's Data Science jobs in Hong Kong\n",

    "It is no surprise that Computer Science, English, and Communication skills are highly sought after in Data Science Jobs here in Hong Kong. What's surprising is that only 3-4% of Job Descriptions in Hong Kong mention a PHD requirement - which can often be seen as a requirement in the United States. Another nice touch for expats looking to get Data Science jobs in Hong Kong is that Cantonese and Mandarin are only mentioned as a requirement in about 15% of job descriptions and English is the dominant language in the job market here. Out of all the hard skills, SQL, Python, Statistics, and Machine Learning are the top sought after skills."
